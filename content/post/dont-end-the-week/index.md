This is the first post on this site. 

"Dont end the week with nothing" is one of the best advice I have ever received. 
It can be applied to many aspects of our lives. We can apply this to relationship, financial, career etc.. 
What this means is that always end the week on a high note. End the week by being better than the previous week. 
This overtime builds up and real success is possible if we follow this regularly. 
This also forces us to plan and think about what improvement means to us. 
It puts things to perspective and I highly suggest doing this every Sunday. 

Here is the original site with some more excellent career advice.

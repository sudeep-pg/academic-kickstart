I'm a Senior Engineer at Qualcomm CDMA Technologies. I'm currently a part of Network Protocol software organization, working on network system selection and developing alrogithms that assist in managing voice/data/emergency calls over cellular network. 

My main interests are in application of SW enginering for mobile computing, finance and IoT. 
I'm also interested in the things that are at the interesection of business , technology and engineering - Product Management. 

I completed my Masters in Electrical Engineering from UT Arlington where I worked with Dr.K.R.Rao (url: "https://qualcomm.com") in optimizing H.264 video codec for graphics processors.
